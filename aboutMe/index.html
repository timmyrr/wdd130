    <p>Currently I am pursuing computer science, and I also have a strong interest
        in AI and statistics. Throughout my life I have played soccer competitively. I love spaghetti and steak
        I'm too young to get married, let alone consider have children or even grandchildren.</p>
    <p>Web design is a step along the path to my career, so I feel like it is a useful skill to learn. Having been 
        born and raised in Utah, all of my family, friends, and neighbours have been members. My favourite quote 
        comes from Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin, "Come what may, and love it".
